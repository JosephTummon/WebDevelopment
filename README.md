# WebDevelopment
Repository with projects I built for my Web Development module in college. Learnt the basics of JavaScript, HTML and CSS and how to build my own website and how to add new functions and features to a website.

I have also included personal project that visualises various sorting algorithms which I completed to get some experience using React.
